# Ap√©ndice B. Conclusions and Future Work

## Conclusions

In today's world, characterized by constant time pressure and the growing demand for efficiency, having effective tools for task management becomes indispensable. In this context, the *GTD* method stands out for its systematic and structured approach, helping individuals to organize their activities effectively and to maintain focus on priority tasks

*SwiftDo* has been conceived with the intention of providing a solution to the organizational needs of users. In the development of this app, we have focused on efficiency and clear objectives as well as several key aspects:

- **Application of GTD Concepts and Values:**  *SwiftDo* manages to be an effective tool for time management and personal organization, successfully fulfilling all the points explained by the author of the *GTD* method. Providing a structured, minimalist approach, backed by a set of design techniques and principles.

- **Cross-platform infrastructure**: By employing technologies such as *React Native* for client development, we have managed to create an app that can run on a wide variety of devices and operating systems. This feature ensures that users can access their tasks and projects from anywhere at any time, no matter what device they are using.

- **REST infrastructure**: With the infrastructure implemented on the backend, we have managed to develop a service that is easy to understand and maintain thanks to the principles of the REST architecture. In addition, we have done it in an environment and with technologies widely used today such as *Node.js* and *Express.js*. For this reason, this service, apart from fulfilling its function, will be able to continue to develop, improve and expand in the future.

- **Enforcement of safety standards**: Having the right security measures has become a crucial aspect for any service, and even more so if it deals with personal data. That is why we have invested a large part of the development of this application in including a secure and reliable data access system such as *OAuth2.0*, facing one of the most important challenges in web services today, such as privacy and security.

- **Offline mode**: Aware that users may find themselves in situations where they do not have an Internet connection, we have designed our app to work efficiently even in offline mode. Users can access and update their tasks offline, and once they recover the connection, the changes are automatically synced to the server, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience.

- **Configuration on personal servers**: In order to meet the specific needs of our users, the app can be deployed and managed on any infrastructure. This is especially useful for businesses or organizations that want to maintain full control over their internal data and processes, as it allows them to use our app on their own infrastructure without compromising information security or privacy.

These achievements are the result of a great effort on the part of the team in the development of this application, motivated to contribute our knowledge to the cause of solving a real problem. We're proud to have created an app that not only helps people organize their lives more effectively, but also allows them to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing environment.

## Future Work

In this section, we'll explore the ideas and improvements planned for the future of *SwiftDo*. We list below the areas where we are looking to innovate and the new features we plan to implement to further improve the user experience.

- **Improved integration with conversational agents**: Our goal is to extend the functionality of *Alexa*. For example, we plan to implement the ability to add projects and areas, and be able to link them to tasks. In addition, we will explore alternatives to expand compatibility with other virtual assistants to improve accessibility and user experience:

- **Logging in with third-party accounts**: Implement the option to sign in with *Google*, *Apple* or other third-party accounts to simplify the authentication process and improve security.

- **Improved user interface**: Refine the dialog boxes and task creation interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.

- **Desktop app support to more platforms**: Develop a desktop version of *SwiftDo* compatible with platforms such as Linux to expand its reach and accessibility.

- **Rich Text Editor**: Integrate a rich text editor that allows users to format their task descriptions more flexibly and customarily.

- **Improvement of the offline mode**: Improve the synchronization process with the server, as well as extend the *cache* storage to the rest of the entities.
